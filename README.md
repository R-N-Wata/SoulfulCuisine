## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Designed using figma, and following UI/UX design patterns. Built with the goal of creating a stylish yet simple website. 


## Optimizations

For improvement I would like to make the  site more dynamic, include a login where users can save favourite dishes or save dishes they've already tried with an ability to rate them.


## Lessons Learned:

I really enjoyed creating some of the animations, most of them were created using CSS.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
